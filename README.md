# PythonGUIAutomation
 I have automated a python script to execute two jobs(Paint, Google chrome) for the windows 1366x768 resolution. I have used limited action on both jobs but we can do more operation on these jobs or other jobs. GUI automation powered by the PyAutoGUI package(pip install pyautogui). Python tools used Pycharm community, we can use any other tools. Please contact me if you have a query.  Email:- kumarmuthuece5@gmail.com
